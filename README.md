ASIC - Digitization of the office reception process


## Business/Technical Challenge

Business Challenges:
Think about your last external meeting experience as a visitor. Sometimes you have to wait in a line to talk to a receptionist to identify yourself, usually it's not easy to find the person you are going to meet, after you are registered you don't know the facility, where are the restrooms, how to get to your meeting room. And finally, when everything is done and you are in the meeting room, the visited person is there with you and suddenly you need to do a dCloud demo using their Wi-Fi internet access. For that you will start another process to get the Guest Internet credentials, filling adicional forms. It's simply a mess, very inefficient for you as a visitor and for the host company, that isn't giving a good experience for his customers and guests.

Technical Challenges:
The main challenge today is that the multiple systems that are used during the visitor journey are independent, not integrated or automated. Leaving all the complexity to the receptionist.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution will easy your experience as a visitor when on site, covering all the steps since when you walk in to the company lobby, until when you leave. Find who you will meet with, contact this person, display and guide you to where this meeting is going to be and automatically provide you the guest internet access.
