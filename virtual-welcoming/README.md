ASIC - Digitization of the office reception process


## Business/Technical Challenge

Business Challenges:
Today, in every business reception we have a highly human dependent process to get in the location, think about your experience in your last external meeting, sometimes you have to wait in the line, the receptionist cannot find the person you are going to meet, after you are registered you don't know the facility, where are the restrooms, how to your meeting room. And finally when everything is done, you are in the meeting room, the visited person is there with you and suddenly you need to do a dCloud demo... so, you will start another process to get the Guest Internet credentials, filling adicional forms.
Technical Challenges:
Multiple independent systems, no integration and zero automation.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution proposes the digitisation of your experience when approaching any office reception, covering all the steps since when you walk in to when you leave. Find who you will meet with, contact this person, display and guide you to where this meeting is going to be and self provide you the guest internet access.
